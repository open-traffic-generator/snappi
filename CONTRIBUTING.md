When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make, via issue or email (open-traffic-generator@googlegroups.com), with the owners of this repository.

## Steps to Contribute

This repo uses GitHub to manage reviews of [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.

If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request, and submit it for review.

## Pull Request Checklist

* Branch from the main branch and, if needed, rebase to the current main branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with main you may be asked to rebase your changes.

* Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).

* If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment. You can also send a message to open-traffic-generator@googlegroups.com.  

* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
