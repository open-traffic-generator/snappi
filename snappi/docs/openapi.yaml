            The Domain Name part of the option carries all or part of the FQDN of a DHCPv6 client. A client MAY also leave the  Domain Name field empty if it desires the server to provide a name. A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is the complete  address of an internet host or computer. It provides its exact location within the domain name system (DNS) by specifying  the hostname, domain name and top-level domain (TLD). An FQDN isn't the same as a URL but rather is a part of it that fully  identifies the server to which the request is addressed. An FQDN doesn't carry the TCP/IP protocol information, such as Hypertext  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which is always used at the beginning of a URL. Therefore,  adding the prefix http:// or https:// to the FQDN turns it into a full URL. One example can be microsoft.com.

            Optional Extended Community settings. The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value. It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities. When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two  byte local administrator id.  When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id.  When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes  contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from  IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847). When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format.  When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the  last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates  occur for the same MAC address.

            Optional Extended Community settings. The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value. It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities. When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two  byte local administrator id.  When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id.  When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes  contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from  IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847). When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format.  When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the  last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates  occur for the same MAC address.

            Optional Extended Community settings. The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value. It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities. When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two  byte local administrator id.  When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id.  When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes  contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from  IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847). When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format.  When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the  last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates  occur for the same MAC address.

            Optional Extended Community settings. The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value. It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities. When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two  byte local administrator id.  When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id.  When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes  contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from  IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847). When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format.  When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the  last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates  occur for the same MAC address.  Note evpn type is defined mainly for use with evpn route updates and not for IPv4 and IPv6 route updates.

            Optional Extended Community settings. The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value. It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities. When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two  byte local administrator id.  When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id.  When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes  contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from  IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847). When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format.  When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the  last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates  occur for the same MAC address.  Note evpn type is defined mainly for use with evpn route updates and not for IPv4 and IPv6 route updates.

            Optional Extended Community settings. The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value. It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities. When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two  byte local administrator id.  When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id.  When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes  contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from  IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847). When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format.  When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the  last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates  occur for the same MAC address.

        The Graceful Restart Capability (RFC 4724) is a BGP capability that can be used by a BGP speaker to indicate its ability to preserve its forwarding state during BGP restart. The Graceful Restart (GR) capability is advertised in OPEN messages sent between BGP peers. After a BGP session has been established, and the initial routing update has been completed,  an End-of-RIB (Routing Information Base) marker is sent in an UPDATE message to convey information  about routing convergence.

            Optional Extended Community settings. The Extended Communities Attribute is a transitive optional BGP attribute, with the Type Code 16. Community and Extended Communities  attributes are utilized to trigger routing decisions, such as acceptance, rejection,  preference, or redistribution. An extended community is an 8-Bytes value. It is divided into two main parts. The first 2 Bytes of the community encode a type and sub-type fields and the last 6 Bytes carry a unique set of data in a format defined by the type and sub-type field. Extended communities provide a larger  range for grouping or categorizing communities. When type is administrator_as_2octet or administrator_as_4octet, the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_as_2octet and administrator_as_4octet type is either two byte AS followed by four byte local administrator id or four byte AS followed by two  byte local administrator id.  When type is administrator_ipv4_address the valid sub types are route target and origin. The valid value for  administrator_ipv4_address is a four byte IPv4 address followed by a two byte local administrator id.  When type is opaque, valid sub types are color and encapsulation. When sub type is color, first two bytes of the value field contain flags and last four bytes  contains the value of the color. When sub type is encapsulation the first four bytes of value field are reserved and last two bytes carries the tunnel type from  IANA's "ETHER TYPES" registry e.g IPv4 (protocol type = 0x0800), IPv6 (protocol type = 0x86dd), and MPLS (protocol type = 0x8847). When type is administrator_as_2octet_link_bandwidth the valid sub type is extended_bandwidth. The first two bytes of the value field contains the AS number and the last four bytes contains the bandwidth in IEEE floating point format.  When type is evpn the valid subtype is mac_address. In the value field the low-order bit of the first byte(Flags) is defined as the "Sticky/static" flag and may be set to 1, indicating the MAC address is static and cannot move. The second byte is reserved and the  last four bytes contain the sequence number which is used to ensure that PEs retain the correct MAC/IP Advertisement route when multiple updates  occur for the same MAC address.

            Each VTEP maintains an ARP suppression cache table for known IP hosts and their associated MAC addresses in the VNI segment.  When an end host in the VNI sends an ARP request for another end-host IP address,  its local VTEP intercepts the ARP request and checks for the ARP-resolved IP address in its ARP suppression cache table.  If it finds a match, the local VTEP sends an ARP response on behalf of the remote end host.

A pseudonode is a logical representation of the LAN which is generated by a Designated Intermediate System (DIS) on a LAN segment. If one LSP exceeds the maximum LSP size then it is sent in another LSP with the LSP number incremented by one. A router's learned LSP gets refreshed by 'remaining_lifetime'. Then the sequence number is incremented by 1.
